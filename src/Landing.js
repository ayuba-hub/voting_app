            Choice Coin DAO: Bringing Decentralized Governance to the Algorand
            Blockchain
          </p>
          <p className="suby">
            Choice Coin is an Algorand Standard Asset (ASA) that powers the
            Choice Coin DAO, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization built on
            the Algorand Blockchain. The Choice Coin DAO aims to make
            decentralized voting a reality through allocations to open-source
            software development and community awareness.
            <br />
            <br />
      Decentralized Decisions is an open source software platform for decentralized voting and governance. With over 75 contributors on GitHub, it is also the largest open source software project on the Algorand blockchain. The goal for Choice Coin is to help solve the decentralized governance problem by building the worldâ€™s best voting technology. Choice Coin is built, developed, and maintained by the Choice Coin DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization on the Algorand blockchain. Vote 1 is the second vote for the Choice Coin DAO.
